# AI Workflow Toolkit

Prompts and templates for building production software with AI assistance.

## Quick Start

### 1. Validate Your Idea (3 conversations)
1. [Goal Definition](prompts/goal-definition.md) - Define what you want
2. [Devil's Advocate](prompts/devils-advocate.md) - Challenge it  
3. [Goal Synthesis](prompts/goal-synthesis.md) - Decide final scope

### 2. Plan Architecture
- [Architecture Planning](prompts/architecture-planning.md) - Design before coding

### 3. Implement
Choose based on complexity:
- [Step-by-Step](templates/step-by-step.md) - High control, one substep at a time
- [Phase-by-Phase](templates/phase-by-phase.md) - Balanced, complete phases at once

### 4. Polish & Secure
- [UX De-AI-ification](prompts/ux-deai.md) - Make design unique
- [Security Audit](prompts/security-audit.md) - Before production

## What This Is

Copy-paste prompts for AI conversations. No frameworks, no tools to install.

## Structure

```
prompts/          # Individual prompts
templates/        # Full implementation plans
examples/         # Real project examples (coming soon)
```
