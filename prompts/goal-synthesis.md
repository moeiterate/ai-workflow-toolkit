# Goal Synthesis

**When to use:** After goal definition AND devil's advocate. Final validation step.

## Prompt

```
Given these project goals:
[PASTE GOAL DEFINITION]

And these concerns/risks:
[PASTE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE CRITIQUE]

Synthesize a balanced approach that:
1. Addresses the critical risks
2. Maintains core value proposition
3. Defines realistic MVP scope
4. Identifies must-have vs nice-to-have features
5. Acknowledges known trade-offs

Provide a final specification that balances ambition with pragmatism.
```
