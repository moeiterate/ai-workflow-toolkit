## What to Do with ReThread Internal Page

The PromptLibrary page at `/Users/moazelhag/Desktop/VSCode/ReThread/src/pages/PromptLibrary.tsx` can be:

**Option 1: Delete it** (simple, GitHub is source of truth)
**Option 2: Replace with link** (point to GitHub repo)
**Option 3: Archive it** (move to archive folder)

Recommend: Delete it, keep things simple.

## Key Differences from Internal Page

- ✅ Simpler structure (no UI, just markdown)
- ✅ GitHub-native (easy to share, fork, PR)
- ✅ Goal synthesis moved after devil's advocate (better order)
- ✅ No over-engineering - just copy-paste prompts
- ✅ Public and shareable

## Files in Repo

1. **README.md** - Main entry point, quick start
2. **6 prompts** - Each is copy-paste ready
3. **2 templates** - Full implementation plans
4. **GITHUB_SETUP.md** - Instructions for you

All committed and ready to push!
